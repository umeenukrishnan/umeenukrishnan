### Hi there 👋

I am a Research scholar in computational mechanics. Since January 2019, I have been working in the [Computational Mechanics Lab](https://computationalmechanics.in/rajib_teams/u-meenu-krishnan-2/), focusing on fracture mechanics using the phase field approach to simulate how cracks form and propagate in materials.

My main goal is to develop a computationally efficient method for solving phase-field fracture problems, enabling us to tackle more realistic and practical challenges. To achieve this, I focus on space adaptivity and parallelizing the code, ensuring that we can accurately capture the details of the fracture process and solve large problems faster using high-performance computing.

Beyond fracture mechanics, I also work on the topology optimization of large-scale practical problems. This involves finding the best material distribution within a design space for optimal performance. Currently, our team is working on implementing phase field methods for large-scale topology optimization problems, aiming to create efficient solutions for real-world applications.

In addition to my research, I am the co-founder of [EigenPlus](https://eigenplus.com), a platform dedicated to sharing the knowledge and practical skills I have gained throughout my career. One of my passions is helping others by imparting what I have learned, and I firmly believe in Steve Jobs’s quote: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” When you love what you do, you put your heart and soul into it, resulting in outstanding work. Through EigenPlus, I strive to inspire others to achieve greatness by loving what they do.
