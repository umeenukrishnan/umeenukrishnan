### Hi there 👋💃

<img src="https://github.com/umeenukrishnan/umeenukrishnan/blob/main/blog.mp4" alt="banner that says U. Meenu Krishnan - fracture mechanics, topology optimization, phase field method.">

I want to state a principle that I abide by:

> “It’s not just about the supercomputers available but about how smartly one designs and optimizes the code to efficiently use the available resources.”



I am a Research scholar in computational mechanics. Since January 2019, I have been working in the [Computational Mechanics Lab](https://computationalmechanics.in/rajib_teams/u-meenu-krishnan-2/), focusing on the phase field method. 

My main goal is to develop a computationally efficient method for solving phase-field fracture problems, enabling us to tackle more realistic and practical challenges. To achieve this, I focus on space adaptivity and parallelizing the code, ensuring that we can accurately capture the details of the fracture process and solve large problems faster using high-performance computing.

Beyond fracture mechanics, I also work on the topology optimization of large-scale practical problems. This involves finding the best material distribution within a design space for optimal performance. Currently, I am working on implementing phase field methods for large-scale topology optimization problems, aiming to create efficient solutions for real-world applications.

In addition to my research, I am the co-founder of [EigenPlus](https://eigenplus.com), a platform dedicated to sharing the knowledge and practical skills I have gained throughout my career. One of my passions is helping others by imparting what I have learned, and I firmly believe in Steve Jobs’s quote: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” ❤️ When you love what you do, you put your heart and soul into it, resulting in outstanding work. Through EigenPlus, I strive to inspire others to achieve greatness by loving what they do.
